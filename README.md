A simple HTTP Server written in Python:
It returns the REMOTE_ADDR to connecting clients.

Inspired by
* <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BaseHttpServer>
* and <http://www.righto.com/2011/02/ipv6-web-serving-with-arc-or-python.html>

All this server needs is Python 3.3 (there's a branch with support for Python 2.7 too).

To start the server, simply run the module like this: `./whatsmyip.py`.
